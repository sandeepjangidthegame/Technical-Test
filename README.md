# Technical Test
 Create a simple Login System for Test

Backend: 

I've started working on this using npm init, setting some information for the project than working on the development part, I use some modules like (bcrypt, dotenv, express, jsonwebtoken, mysql and velidator).

bcrypt is used to convert and compare the password to not store it in plain text format.
dotenv is used to set some variables to access them anywhere in the project.
express is used to handle HTTP requests 
jsonwebtoken is used to create tokens for sessions management
mysql is used to manage and database
validator is used to validate the user inputs.
